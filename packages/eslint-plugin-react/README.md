React 19+ rules for ESLint 10 that Biome does not provide. Use it alongside
Biome 2.5.13 or later, which owns general JavaScript, JSX, DOM, and React
checks. This package is a fork of
[`jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react)
maintained by [Vladimir Iglovikov](https://github.com/ternaus). It uses native ESM and preserves the `react/*` namespace, upstream Git history, and MIT attribution.

## What this package is for

This package is designed for projects using:

- ESLint 10
- Biome 2.5.13+
- Node.js 24.15+ and 26
- flat config in `eslint.config.js`

Start with Biome's `all` preset. Add this plugin for React 19 contracts that
Biome does not yet expose, such as invalid HTML attribute values, controlled
form handlers, and React APIs removed in version 19. The `recommended` preset
contains the entire supported package contract.

React 18 and earlier, ESLint 9, and `.eslintrc*` files are not supported.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add --dev @biomejs/biome@'>=2.5.13' eslint@^10 @ternaus/eslint-plugin-react
```

### Use it with `eslint-config-next`

`eslint-config-next` imports the React plugin under the package name
`eslint-plugin-react`. The following example uses Yarn 4's `resolutions`
syntax; npm, pnpm, and Yarn Classic use their own dependency override
mechanisms.

Install Biome, ESLint, and `@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react` as direct
development dependencies:

```sh
pnpm add --dev @biomejs/biome@'>=2.5.13' eslint@^10 @ternaus/eslint-plugin-react@8.0.2
```

Enable Biome's `all` preset, including its React domain, as shown in [Use it
with Biome](#use-it-with-biome). Then map the transitive package name to the
same published package with Yarn:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "eslint-plugin-react": "npm:@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react@8.0.2"
  }
}
```

Keep the version in `devDependencies` and `resolutions` synchronized. This
prevents `eslint-config-next` from installing the ESLint 9-only native React
plugin alongside the ESLint 10 package. `eslint-config-next` registers the
resolved plugin under the `react` namespace, so no second React plugin
registration is needed in your flat config.

## Use it with Biome

Enable Biome's recommended and additional stable rules, including the React
domain:

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "domains": { "react": "all" },
    "rules": { "preset": "all" }
  }
}
```

Then add this package's residual React checks to `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import react from '@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react';

export default [
  {
    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx}'],
    ...react.configs.flat.recommended,
  },
];
```

Keep this React config scoped to JavaScript and TypeScript source files that
your parser can handle as JSX. Configure Markdown, JSON, CSS, and other
processor-managed files separately instead of applying React rules to a broad
`**/*` glob.

### Use `defineConfig`

`defineConfig` can resolve the plugin's flat presets by name. Register the
plugin under `react`, then extend the matching `react/flat/*` alias:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'eslint/config';
import react from '@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx}'],
  plugins: { react },
  extends: ['react/flat/recommended'],
});
```

The available alias is `react/flat/recommended`. The same config is available
for direct composition through `react.configs.flat.recommended`.

Run both tools, then review and apply available automatic fixes:

```sh
pnpm exec biome check .
pnpm exec biome check . --write
pnpm exec eslint .
pnpm exec eslint . --fix
```

The package is native ESM, but Node.js 24.15+ and 26 can load it with
`require`. A CommonJS flat config uses the same plugin object:

```js
const react = require('@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react');

module.exports = [
  {
    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx}'],
    ...react.configs.flat.recommended,
  },
];
```

The plugin is always registered as `react`, so rule IDs stay in the familiar
`react/rule-name` form even though the package is scoped.

## Choose the checks you need

<!-- rule-config-summary:start -->
| Config | Active rules | Use it when |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `recommended` | 19 | You want the supported baseline of React 19 contracts that Biome does not provide. |
| `all` | 20 | You want every rule, including checks with a deliberately narrower static-analysis boundary. |
<!-- rule-config-summary:end -->

Use `recommended` for normal development. Use `all` when you also want checks
whose static-analysis boundary can require project-specific review. You can
raise the two performance signals to errors when that fits your project:

```js
import react from '@ternaus/eslint-plugin-react';

const recommended = react.configs.flat.recommended;

export default [
  {
    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx}'],
    ...recommended,
    rules: {
      ...recommended.rules,
      'react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values': 'error',
    },
  },
];
```

The [rule catalog](docs/rules/README.md) lists every rule, what it reports, and
whether it supports `--fix` or an editor suggestion. Each rule name links to
examples and its analysis boundary.

The catalog is exhaustive. For an upstream rule ID that is absent here, read
[why this package does not support it](docs/upstream-rule-support.md) before
adding a compatibility request.

## Platform boundary

Platform-neutral JSX and React-core checks can analyze React Native source, but
this package has no React Native compatibility contract or native-specific
preset. Rules about HTML and React DOM form behavior operate only on proven
lowercase HTML elements; they skip `View`, `Text`, custom elements, SVG,
MathML, and dynamic host elements.

## React version behavior

React version detection is not part of this package: every rule has one React
19+ behavior path and never reads `react/package.json`. Biome owns the
overlapping React and JSX checks. Each remaining rule page documents its own
analysis boundary.

## How the project verifies rule behavior

Every rule has a focused reference page and regression tests with ESLint's
current parser. The complete quality command also enforces coverage thresholds,
validates the generated rule catalog, inspects the published archive, and loads
that archive as ESM, CommonJS, and TypeScript.

## Develop the plugin

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run quality:complete
```

Biome formats the repository and owns general JavaScript, JSX, DOM, and React
rules; its completeness check requires every exception to be registered with a
reason. ESLint enforces the residual Node.js and ESLint-plugin authoring rules.
