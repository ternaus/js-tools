# react/no-invalid-html-attribute

Reports static HTML attributes and literal values that HTML5 metadata forbids
for a React DOM intrinsic element. It is enabled in `recommended`.

The rule uses the checked-in HTML metadata contract in
[`lib/html5-attributes.js`](../../lib/html5-attributes.js). The module is
published with this package, so linting does not read the filesystem or load an
external validator at runtime. To update the metadata, verify the change
against the relevant WHATWG section, record the source link, inspect the data
diff, and run `yarn quality:complete`.

Read [HTML and React attribute contract](../html-react-attribute-contract.md)
before changing the metadata or adding a manual exception. It defines the
authoritative sources, the HTML-versus-React boundary, and the required review
matrix.

## Incorrect

```jsx
<div href="/docs" />

<button type="link" />

<input type="telephone" />
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';

React.createElement('form', { method: 'put' });
```

## Correct

```jsx
<button type="submit" data-variant="compact" aria-label="Save" />

<button type="submit" name="operation">Save</button>

<div align="center" />
```

Obsolete-but-valid HTML is intentionally not reported. `data-*` and `aria-*`
attributes are also outside this rule; use an accessibility-focused tool for
ARIA semantics.

## Boundaries

The rule analyzes lowercase HTML elements in JSX and statically proven
`React.createElement` calls. PascalCase components, custom elements, React
Native host components, SVG and MathML are skipped. Dynamic values, unknown
spreads, and unknown attribute spellings are skipped as well: spelling belongs
to Biome's `suspicious/noUnknownAttribute`, and this rule avoids duplicating it.

No automatic fix is offered because removing or changing an attribute can alter
application behavior.
